# About the Project
PhilanthroNet is a decentralized charity platform that aims to revolutionize the way people donate to charitable organizations. It combines the power of blockchain technology with the appeal of NFTs to create a truly transparent and accountable donation system. This platform allows users to donate Ether (ETH) to their desired charitable organization and receive unique NFTs as a reward for their generosity.
